# EtherPlay
This repo is a restructured framework for development due to some issues with the previous one, and you can find the old repository here https://github.com/Norman2115/etherplay.

## Problem Statement
Many people purchase illegal or modified DLL copies of Steam games online. While this may reduce costs for lots of people, it undermines the game publisher's revenue, disrupts the integrity of digital rights management and limits long-term support for the game.

## App Description
EtherPlay is a decentralized, Steam-like game distribution platform that uses blockchain technology to issue NFTs for every game purchase. These NFTs serve as proof of ownership. They ensures authenticity and verification of game purchases. With EtherPlay, every purchased game comes with a unique NFT that acts as a digital certificate, allowing users to prove the legitimacy of their game libraries.

### How EtherPay Solves the Problem
1. Game Verification: We issue an NFT with each game purchase. EtherPlay verifies ownership through the blockchain. This NFT is non-fungible.

2. Protection Against Illegal Copies. Users with legitimate NFTs can access the full, authentic game content, while illegal copies will be unable to bypass the verification.

3. Support for Game Publisher. Etherpay ensures they are compensated for each game sold.
